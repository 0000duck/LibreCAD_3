LibreCAD_3
==========

LibreCAD 3 development (GSoC 2014)
This is the new LibreCAD Kernel. With keeping in mind the extensibilty, modularity and the design, the LibreCAD is divided into 3 parts.  
1) The UI  
2) The kernel  
3) The CADViewer  


Compilation Instructions
==========

Install cairo  
Install Qt 5  
Install git  
Install liblog4cxx  
Install Google test  
 
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD_3.git

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. (for a release you would use cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..)
make -j 4
./lcUI/librecad
```


OSX MacPorts
========
If you want to fool around with macports use these build instructions

```
mkdir build
cd build
/opt/local/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/gcc ..
make -j 4
./lcUI/librecad
```

For a release build you would do:
```
/opt/local/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/local/bin/gcc ..
```

MacPorts/brew might not have **libdxfrw** in it so you need to compile it yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/rvt/libdxfrw
cd libdxfrw
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
sudo make install
```

OSX X-Code
========

If you like X-Code as your editor you can ask cmake to generate the build file for you.  
mkdir xcode  
cd build  
cmake -G Xcode ..  

Then open the project in x-code and buikd.
Under some conditions you might want to set a additional search path if libraries are not found, for example if you compile **libdxfrw** yourself.

When using ports I had to use:

```
cd /opt/local/include
sudo ln -sf eigen3/Eigen Eigen
sudo ln -sf eigen3/unsupported unsupported
```

any cmake guru care to comment on this oddity? Is there a way to prevent making that symlink?

Ubuntu/Mint
========

```
apt-get install qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5opengl5-dev liblua5.2-dev git g++ gcc-4.8 libcairo2-dev liblog4cxx10-dev libpango-1.0-0 libpango1.0-dev libboost-all-dev
```

MSYS2
========

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo mingw-w64-x86_64-pango mingw-w64-x86_64-lua mingw-w64-x86_64-eigen3 mingw-w64-x86_64-apr mingw-w64-x86_64-apr-util mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-gtest
```

###Log4CXX:

Use lastest code from repo : git://git.apache.org/log4cxx.git
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOGCXX-463

Put the source in /third_party/apache-log4cxx

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

###LibDxfrw:
Get code from https://github.com/rvt/libdxfrw.git
```
cmake . 
make
make install
```

###LibreCAD:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWINDOWS_MSYS2=ON ..
```

Create symlinks for .so files with ```ln -s ../lc*/lib*.so```

Replace paths in build/lcUI/path.lua with Windows-style pathes ```C:\msys64\â€¦```

Reading materials for feature usage

If we want to support associative drawings, this is a good introduction to get started
